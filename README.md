# secret-rs
Rust bindings for [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret).
This library is at a very early stage of development, contributions are welcome!

## Usage
To use this library in your project, add the following to your Cargo.toml:
```
[dependencies.secret]
git = "https://github.com/nicokoch/secret-rs/"
```

Documentation can be generated with `cargo doc`

A lot of features from libsecret are missing, so feel free to send me a pull request if you need a certain feature.
