initSidebarItems({"struct":[["SecretItem","SecretItem represents a secret item stored in the Secret Service. Each item has a value, represented by a SecretValue, which can be retrieved by `get_secret()` or set by `set_secret()` (TODO). The item is only available when the item is not locked. Items can be locked or unlocked using the `Lock::lock()` or `Lock::unlock()` functions. The Lock trait is implemented by SecretItem. The Secret Service may not be able to unlock individual items, and may unlock an entire collection when a single item is unlocked. Each item has a set of attributes, which are used to locate the item later. These are not stored or transferred in a secure manner. Each attribute has a string name and a string value. Use `SecretService::search()` to search for items based on their attributes, and `set_attributes()` (TODO) to change the attributes associated with an item. Items can be created with `create()` (TODO) or `SecretService::store()`."]]});
